## Filtering by distance

Great! You now have a procedure that can work out the distance between two addresses. Next you'll add this to your `when FireBase.GotValue` function.

For this you of course need two addresses: the address of the accessible place and your address (the address of the app user).

+ First you should get your current location. As you will be using this value multiple times, it's a good idea to store it as a variable. Add an `initialize global name to` block, change its name to `currentLocation`, and set it to an empty text block.

+ In the `when ListOfPlaces.Initialize` block, add a `set global currentLocation to` block and connect it with a `get LocationSensor.CurrentAddress` block.  

But what if the user's location is unavailable? To cover this possibility, you need to do a check before setting the `currentLocation` variable.

+ Put an `if then` block into `when ListOfPlaces.Initialize` and move the `set global currentLocation` code into the `then`.    

+ Find the `LocationSensor.HasLongitudeLatitude` block and attach it to the `if`:

Now you are ready to use the procedure you made to get the distance.

+ Insert an `initialize local name to` block (the one with a top attachment) into the `then` in your `when FireBase.GotValue`, and change `name` to `distance`. 

+ You only want to use the distance formula if you know the user's location, so connect an `if then else` block (the one that has a side attachment). To the `if`, attach three blocks: `not` (Logic), `is empty` (Text), and `get global currentLocation`. 

+ Connect a `call distanceBetween` block to the `then`. If the `currentLocation` is blank, you will just show all the places, so place a `0` Math block in the `else` to return zero as the distance.

+ For one of the **parameters** (values that you pass to the function) of the `call distanceBetween`, attach a `get global currentLocation` block. For the other parameter, attach a `get value` block (remember this contains the address of the place you got from Firebase).

+ Inside the `initialize local distance to` block, add an `if then` block.

You are now going to check whether the distance is less than 5km.

+ Get a `<` block and a a `0` block from the Math section.

+ Put a `get distance` into the first input in the `<` block, and the `0` block into the second input. Set the `0` block to `5`.

+ Plug the `<` block into the `if then` block.

+ Move the `add items to list` block so it is inside the `then` statement of the `if then` block.

+ If everything has gone correctly, it should look like this:
