## Implementing a procedure to work out distances

Now that you know how to work out distance, you can make your app only show places that are within 5km of a user.

+ Drag out a **procedure** block (the result one) and call it `distanceBetween`. Click on the wrench icon in the top left-hand corner and drag two inputs into it. Name these `address1` and `address2`.

+ Next, from the Variables section, drag out a `initialize local name to` block (the one that has a side attachment instead of a top attachment).

![](images/distanceProcedureStart.png)

+ Add six variables to this: `lat1`, `long1`, `lat2`, `long2`, `x`, and `y`. Use the same method you used for the procedure, by clicking on the wrench icon in the corner of the `initialise local` block.

+ Now you need a way of converting text addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates. Thankfully, the LocationSensor does this, so go to the **Designer** view and add one.

+ Get two `call LocationSensor.LatitudeFromAddress` blocks. Attach a `get address1` block to one, and a `get address2` block to the other. Put these into the `lat1` and `lat2` attachments.

+ Repeat the same thing with for longitude.

+ Drag in two `0` blocks and attach these to `initialize local x to` and `initialize local y to` blocks.

+ Get a `do result` block from Control, and put it into the `in` attachment of the (now very big!) `initialize local` block.

Great! Now you need to work out the distance.

+Get out the blocks `set x to`, `get lat1`, `get lat2`, `x`, `-`, and `0`.

+ Place the `get lat2` and `get lat1` block into the `-` block, and place the `-` block into the `x` block.

Now youâ€™ve got the difference in latitude!

+ Multiply this by `111` to get the distances in kilometres between the two latitudes. Then just plug that into the `set x to` block, and put the `set x to` block into the `do` section of the `do result` block.

+ Do the same thing with the `set y to` block, changing `111` to `89` and `lat` to `long`.

Perfect! With that you have the lengths of two of your triangle's sides to use in the distance formula!

+ From the Math section, get the `square root` and `+` blocks along with two `^`(power) blocks and two `0` blocks.

+ Put a `get x` into the left input of one of the `^` blocks, and put a `get y` into the left input of another. Put the `0` blocks into the `^` block also, with `0` changed to `2`.

This will square both `x` and `y` (`x` squared is `x` times `x`, meaning `x^2 = x * x`).

+ Place both `^` blocks into the `+` block and attach this to the `square root` block. Finally, plug this into the result attachment.

Here is what your finished `distanceBetween` procedure should look like:
