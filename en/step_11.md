## Wrapping Up

You’ve finished — you now have a app that can add locations of accessible places to a shared database and then show people the places in the database that are near to them.

But wait! One last thing!

+ You need to let people go from one screen to another by clicking the buttons. I’ll let you see can you figure it out.

+ You'll need to add code to the `Button.Click` block of the buttons. Look in the Control blocks!

+ Here is the code you need to add to the home screen:

+ Now all that is left for you to do is to test it! Go to **Connection** menu and then select either the emulator, AICompanion, or whichever other method applies to you.

That's it — you're done! I wonder what else you can do now with all the things you have learned. Below are just a few suggestions, but you could think of cooler ideas yourself.

title: Show the distance to places
---

+ At the moment, you get rid of all places that are further than 5km, but the user can’t see the distance to an individual place. How about adding another Label to the list containing the distance to that place!

title: Better distance calculation

On the topic of working out the distances, the method you are using to work out distance in these cards is a bit inaccurate. 

+ How about you try to build an even better system? Look up "App Inventor working out distances" in a search engine.

title: Use a map instead of typing addresses
---

+ Or maybe you could add a map to the "AddPlace" screen. At the moment, you have to type in an address, but what if you could just find it on a map. That would be even cooler!

title: Make a different app!
---

+ There is no reason to keep working on this app if you don't want to. The possibilities are endless! With the same blocks, you could use Firebase to make a messaging app or take advantage of the Clock to make your own alarm clock!
